To detect a country based on its phone number code, you can use a mapping of country codes to their respective countries. Here's a basic approach to achieve this on your website:

1. **Create a Mapping of Country Codes to Country Names**:
   Create a dictionary or a list in your code that maps country calling codes to country names. For example:

   ```javascript
   const countryCodes = {
     "+92": "Pakistan",
     "+971": "United Arab Emirates",
     // Add more country codes and their corresponding countries
   };
   ```

2. **Extract the Country Code from the Input**:
   Write a function to extract the country code from the input number.

   ```javascript
   function getCountryName(phoneNumber) {
     // Extract the country code from the phone number
     const code = phoneNumber.slice(0, 4); // Adjust slice length based on your needs
     return countryCodes[code] || "Unknown country code";
   }
   ```

3. **Handle User Input**:
   When the user inputs a phone number, call the function to detect the country.

   ```javascript
   const phoneNumberInput = "+921234567890"; // Example input
   const countryName = getCountryName(phoneNumberInput);
   console.log(`The phone number belongs to: ${countryName}`);
   ```

4. **Update Your Website**:
   Integrate the above code into your website's form handling logic. For instance, you can use an event listener to call the `getCountryName` function whenever the user inputs or changes their phone number.

Here's an example of how you might integrate this with an HTML form:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Phone Number Detection</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form id="phoneForm">
      <label for="phoneNumber">Enter Phone Number:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="phoneNumber"
        name="phoneNumber"
        placeholder="+92..."
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p id="countryName"></p>

    <script>
      const countryCodes = {
        "+92": "Pakistan",
        "+971": "United Arab Emirates",
        // Add more country codes and their corresponding countries
      };

      function getCountryName(phoneNumber) {
        const code = phoneNumber.slice(0, 4); // Adjust slice length based on your needs
        return countryCodes[code] || "Unknown country code";
      }

      document
        .getElementById("phoneForm")
        .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
          event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form from submitting
          const phoneNumberInput = document.getElementById("phoneNumber").value;
          const countryName = getCountryName(phoneNumberInput);
          document.getElementById(
            "countryName"
          ).textContent = `The phone number belongs to: ${countryName}`;
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example uses JavaScript for simplicity, but you can adapt it to your preferred programming language or framework.

You can use this data in your website by integrating it into your code as shown in the previous response. This will allow you to detect the country based on the phone number's calling code.

/////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////
//////////////////
////////////////
////////

If you're using Next.js, you can integrate country code detection into your app using React components. Here’s a simple example:

1. **Create a Mapping of Country Codes to Country Names**: You can store this mapping in a JSON file or a JavaScript object.

2. **Create a React Component**: Create a component to handle the phone number input and display the detected country.

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Create a Mapping File**:

   Create a file named `countryCodes.js` in your `utils` folder or similar.

   ```javascript
   // utils/countryCodes.js
   export const countryCodes = {
     "+93": "Afghanistan",
     "+355": "Albania",
     "+213": "Algeria",
     "+971": "United Arab Emirates",
     "+92": "Pakistan",
     // Add other country codes and their corresponding countries here
   };
   ```

2. **Create the React Component**:

   Create a new component, e.g., `PhoneNumberInput.js`, in your `components` folder.

   ```javascript
   // components/PhoneNumberInput.js
   import { useState } from "react";
   import { countryCodes } from "../utils/countryCodes";

   const PhoneNumberInput = () => {
     const [phoneNumber, setPhoneNumber] = useState("");
     const [countryName, setCountryName] = useState("");

     const handleInputChange = (event) => {
       const input = event.target.value;
       setPhoneNumber(input);

       // Extract the country code from the phone number
       const code = input.slice(0, 4); // Adjust slice length based on your needs
       setCountryName(countryCodes[code] || "Unknown country code");
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <label htmlFor="phoneNumber">Enter Phone Number:</label>
         <input
           type="text"
           id="phoneNumber"
           value={phoneNumber}
           onChange={handleInputChange}
           placeholder="+92..."
         />
         <p>{countryName}</p>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default PhoneNumberInput;
   ```

3. **Use the Component in a Page**:

   Now you can use the `PhoneNumberInput` component in one of your Next.js pages, such as `index.js`.

   ```javascript
   // pages/index.js
   import PhoneNumberInput from "../components/PhoneNumberInput";

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Phone Number Detection</h1>
         <PhoneNumberInput />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

### Explanation

- **countryCodes.js**: Contains the mapping of country codes to country names.
- **PhoneNumberInput.js**: A React component that handles user input and displays the detected country name.
- **index.js**: A Next.js page that uses the `PhoneNumberInput` component.

This setup will allow you to detect and display the country based on the phone number's country code in your Next.js application.

Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a webpage's content; they don’t appear on the page itself but only in the page's code. Meta tags are essential for SEO because they provide search engines with important information about the page. Here’s a detailed explanation of common meta tags and their usage, particularly in the context of your website using Next.js.

### 1. **Meta Tags Overview**

Meta tags are placed inside the `<head>` section of your HTML document. Here’s a general template:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta name="description" content="Your page description here" />
  <meta
    name="keywords"
    content="Movers, Packers, Dubai, Shifting, Moving company"
  />
  <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Al Khajista Shifting & Movers" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Top movers and packers in Dubai." />
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/image.jpg" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://yourwebsite.com" />
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
  <title>Al Khajista Shifting & Movers</title>
</head>
```

### 2. **Common Meta Tags**

#### a) `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

- **Purpose**: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
- **Importance**: Ensures that your text is displayed correctly on the web, especially for languages with special characters.

#### b) `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

- **Purpose**: Controls how the webpage is displayed on different devices.
- **Importance**: This tag is crucial for responsive web design, ensuring that your site looks good on all devices, especially mobile.

#### c) `<meta name="description" content="Your page description here">`

- **Purpose**: Provides a brief summary of the page's content.
- **SEO Importance**: This description often appears in search engine results beneath the page title. A well-crafted meta description can improve click-through rates (CTR).

#### d) `<meta name="keywords" content="Movers, Packers, Dubai, Shifting, Moving company">`

- **Purpose**: Lists keywords related to the page's content.
- **SEO Importance**: Historically, this tag was important for SEO, but search engines like Google no longer use it for ranking. However, it can still be useful for internal search engines and categorization.

#### e) `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`

- **Purpose**: Tells search engines what to do with the page.
- **Options**:
  - `index, follow`: Instructs search engines to index the page and follow links.
  - `noindex, nofollow`: Tells search engines not to index the page or follow links.
  - **SEO Importance**: This tag is essential for controlling which pages you want to be indexed by search engines.

### 3. **Social Media Meta Tags**

#### a) Open Graph Tags (Facebook, LinkedIn)

- **Purpose**: Control how your content is shared on social media platforms.
- **Tags**:

  - `<meta property="og:title" content="Al Khajista Shifting & Movers">`: The title of your content as it should appear on social media.
  - `<meta property="og:description" content="Top movers and packers in Dubai.">`: A description of your content.
  - `<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/image.jpg">`: An image URL to display.
  - `<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourwebsite.com">`: The URL of your content.

- **SEO Importance**: These tags ensure your content is displayed attractively when shared on social media, improving engagement and CTR.

#### b) Twitter Cards

- **Purpose**: Similar to Open Graph, but specifically for Twitter.
- **Tags**:

  - `<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">`: Determines how your content is displayed on Twitter (e.g., summary, summary_large_image).
  - `<meta name="twitter:title" content="Al Khajista Shifting & Movers">`: The title of your content.
  - `<meta name="twitter:description" content="Top movers and packers in Dubai.">`: A description.
  - `<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/image.jpg">`: An image URL to display.

- **SEO Importance**: Helps optimize how your content appears on Twitter, leading to better engagement.

### 4. **Other Important Tags**

#### a) `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">`

- **Purpose**: Ensures that Internet Explorer renders the content in the latest rendering engine.
- **Importance**: Important for backward compatibility with older versions of Internet Explorer.

#### b) `<meta name="author" content="Your Name or Company">`

- **Purpose**: Specifies the author of the webpage.
- **SEO Importance**: Not directly impactful on SEO but good for branding and credibility.

### 5. **Next.js Specific Implementation**

In a Next.js project, you typically include these meta tags within the `<Head>` component provided by Next.js:

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta name="description" content="Top movers and packers in Dubai." />
        <meta
          name="keywords"
          content="Movers, Packers, Dubai, Shifting, Moving company"
        />
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
        <meta property="og:title" content="Al Khajista Shifting & Movers" />
        <meta
          property="og:description"
          content="Top movers and packers in Dubai."
        />
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/image.jpg" />
        <meta property="og:url" content="https://yourwebsite.com" />
        <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
        <title>Al Khajista Shifting & Movers</title>
      </Head>
      {/* Other page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

### 6. **SEO Best Practices**

- **Unique Meta Descriptions**: Ensure each page has a unique meta description relevant to its content.
- **Optimized Titles**: Your title should be concise, descriptive, and include relevant keywords.
- **Image Alt Tags**: Always use descriptive alt tags for images, which helps with image search optimization.

By properly implementing and optimizing these meta tags, you can significantly improve your website’s SEO performance, ensuring better visibility and ranking on search engines.

The scrolling issue on your website when viewed on mobile devices could be caused by a few common factors related to Next.js, TypeScript, and responsive design. Here are some possible causes and how to fix them:

### 1. **CSS/Overflow Issues:**

- **Problem:** Sometimes, elements might have incorrect CSS properties like `overflow: hidden` or large fixed-position elements that interfere with smooth scrolling.
- **Solution:** Inspect your CSS to ensure that no elements unintentionally restrict scrolling. Use responsive design practices such as media queries (`@media`) to adjust layouts for mobile devices.

### 2. **Improper Viewport Meta Tag:**

- **Problem:** If the viewport meta tag is not properly set, the layout might not scale correctly on mobile devices, leading to awkward scrolling behavior.
- **Solution:** Ensure you have the correct viewport meta tag in your `<Head>` component:
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  ```

### 3. **JavaScript Blocking Main Thread:**

- **Problem:** Heavy JavaScript execution on the main thread can cause jank or lag in scrolling, particularly on mobile devices with less processing power.
- **Solution:** Optimize your JavaScript by splitting bundles, using code-splitting, and offloading non-critical tasks to web workers. You can also use `useEffect` sparingly to avoid blocking rendering.

### 4. **Large Images or Resources:**

- **Problem:** Loading large images or other resources can slow down the page and affect scrolling performance on mobile devices.
- **Solution:** Use image optimization techniques, lazy loading, and ensure that your Next.js app is leveraging built-in image optimization features.

### 5. **Third-Party Libraries:**

- **Problem:** Some third-party libraries may cause performance issues on mobile devices, especially if they are not optimized for mobile or handle scroll events poorly.
- **Solution:** Audit your third-party libraries and ensure they are optimized for mobile. Consider replacing heavy libraries with lighter alternatives if necessary.

### 6. **Hardware-Accelerated CSS:**

- **Problem:** Lack of hardware acceleration for certain CSS properties (like transforms) can cause sluggish scrolling on mobile devices.
- **Solution:** Use CSS properties that trigger hardware acceleration, such as `translateZ(0)` or `translate3d(0, 0, 0)` on elements that need smooth animations.

### 7. **Viewport Height Issues (100vh problem):**

- **Problem:** Using `100vh` for height can cause issues on mobile devices, as the viewport height changes when the browser’s address bar appears/disappears.
- **Solution:** Use JavaScript to dynamically calculate the viewport height on mobile, or use `height: 100%` with proper flexbox settings.

### 8. **Next.js Configuration:**

- **Problem:** Issues with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) or static site generation might be causing rendering delays on mobile.
- **Solution:** Review your Next.js configuration to ensure that components are rendering efficiently, and use dynamic imports where applicable to prevent large initial page loads.

### Steps to Debug:

- Use Chrome DevTools' Performance tab to analyze the scrolling performance and identify bottlenecks.
- Check for any console warnings or errors that might be affecting performance.
- Test on different mobile devices to see if the issue is device-specific.

By addressing these areas, you should be able to improve the scrolling performance of your Next.js site on mobile devices.
